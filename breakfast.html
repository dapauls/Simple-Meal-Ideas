                <h2 class="header bh-1">Homemade cheesecakes</h2>
                <p>Prepare the dough for homemade cheesecakes. To do this, wipe the cottage cheese through a frequent sieve into a bowl. If the cottage cheese is too wet, lay it on a piece of cheesecloth folded in four and wring it out. In a bowl with cottage cheese, add regular and vanilla sugar, as well as salt. Stir. Beat the egg with a whisk. Add to the curd mixture and mix with a spatula or fork. Pour flour into the curd mass. Stir with a spatula until you get a dough of a homogeneous smooth consistency. Place the bowl with cheesecake dough in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Sprinkle the table with flour. Lay out the cottage cheese dough for homemade cheesecakes and form a thick sausage from it with a diameter of about 5 cm. If there is not enough flour, add some more and mix. Cut the resulting "sausage" into slices no more than 1.5 cm thick. Roll each in flour and leave on a table sprinkled with flour until use. In a large frying pan with a diameter of 24-26 cm, heat the vegetable oil well. Put cheesecakes in it and fry for 2 minutes on each side until golden brown. Cover the pan with homemade cheesecakes and keep on low heat for 3 minutes. Serve hot on the table, adding sour cream, condensed milk or jam.</p>

                <p>In a bowl, rub 50 g of flour with butter with your fingertips. You should get a small crumb. Finely chop the pecans and mix with 1 tbsp. l. Sahara. In a large bowl, sift the remaining flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt. Add remaining sugar and cinnamon. Stir. Grate the peeled apples on a coarse grater. Mix with cream, egg and 2 tbsp. l. milk. Add to dry ingredients (including crumbs) and quickly mix until smooth. If the mixture is dry, add the rest of the milk. Divide the batter between cake tins greased with vegetable oil. The molds should be about 2/3 full. Bake in an oven preheated to 200 Â° C for 25 minutes, until fully cooked. For 5 min. Sprinkle with the nut mixture until the end of cooking.</p>

                <h2 class="header bh-3">Yeast-free pancakes</h2>
                <p>Mix flour and salt. Sift into a large bowl, forming a hill. Make a well in the top and crack the eggs into it. Mix flour and eggs. Gradually add milk mixed with water, constantly stirring the mass. You should get a homogeneous, moderately battered dough. If there are lumps, strain the dough through a fine sieve. Bake pancakes on both sides in a hot frying pan greased with vegetable oil. Lubricate the finished pancakes with butter and fold them into a triangle. To serve, dust each hot pancake with powdered sugar and drizzle with lemon juice.</p>
